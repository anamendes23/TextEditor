# Text Editor in Java

This project was built as part of the Coursera course "Data Structures and Performance" by University of California San Diego. You can find this course [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented).

## Concept: String Manipulation

In order to learn and apply this concept, the Flesch index calculation was implemented to the basic text editor.
The Flesch index express how easy or difficult a text is to read. High Flesch indexes (>90) indicate easy to read and low indexes (<30) indicate difficult to read.

Within Strings, regular expressions were utilized to split the text into words, sentences, and syllabes to then calculate the Flesch index score.

## Concept: Big O

This concept is covered to explain the importance in performance when developing applications. To visually represent that, a class DocumentBenchmarking was implemented to measure and compare the performance of the method to calculate the Flesch score implemented in the classes BasicDocument and EfficientDocument.
